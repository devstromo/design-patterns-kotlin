# Facade Pattern
## Structural Design Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, a library, or a framework. This pattern introduces a facade object that acts as a single entry point, which directs calls from the client to the appropriate objects within the system, hiding the complexities of the subsystems.

## Key Components

1. **Facade:**
   - Provides a simplified interface to the overall functionality of the complex subsystem.
   - Delegates client requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
   - Shields clients from subsystem components, thus reducing the number of objects that clients deal with.

2. **Subsystems:**
   - Implement more fine-grained functionalities and operations.
   - Handle work assigned by the Facade object.
   - Components of the subsystem are not aware of the facade; they operate independently and can be used by other systems or facades.

## Advantages

- **Simplicity:** Provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier for the client to interact with the system.
- **Reduced Dependencies:** Clients interact with a single facade instead of a complex set of interfaces, reducing dependencies and simplifying the interactions.
- **Isolation:** Allows easy isolation of components from the complexities of the subsystems which can improve code readability and maintenance.

## Use Cases

- Ideal when there is a complex system with multiple interacting classes, and there is a need to provide a simple interface to the overall system.
- Useful in layering architectures, where systems can be divided into layers with a facade defining how features should interact.
- Applicable when refactoring a large system into a simpler one without changing the system itself but by adding a facade to simplify the interface.

## Considerations

- Overuse can lead to a facade becoming a god object (an object that knows too much or does too much), which can be difficult to maintain.
- The introduction of a facade can sometimes lead to a reduction in flexibility in using the system.
