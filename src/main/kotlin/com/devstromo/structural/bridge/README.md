# Bridge Pattern
## Structural Design Pattern

The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that separates an abstraction from its implementation, allowing the two to vary independently. This pattern involves an interface which acts as a bridge between the abstraction and the concrete classes implementing the interface. It is particularly useful in scenarios where an abstraction can have several implementations, and it is necessary to separate the client code from the implementation details.

## Key Components

1. **Abstraction:**
   - Defines the abstraction's interface.
   - Maintains a reference to an object of the Implementor type.
   - Acts as a bridge between the client and the implementor classes.

2. **Refined Abstraction:**
   - Extends the interface defined by Abstraction.
   - Implements the interface defined by the Abstraction and uses the Implementor objects to carry out certain functionalities.

3. **Implementor:**
   - Defines the interface for implementation classes.
   - Typically provides basic operations which different abstractions will use.

4. **Concrete Implementor:**
   - Implements the operations defined in Implementor.
   - Each Concrete Implementor corresponds to a specific platform and implements the Implementor interface according to the platform's standards.

## Advantages

- **Decoupling Interface and Implementation:** Allows the implementation to be changed independently of the abstraction.
- **Increased Flexibility:** Multiple abstractions can use different independent implementations.
- **Enhanced Extensibility:** New implementations can be added without disturbing the client code.

## Use Cases

- Ideal when you need to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. For instance, when implementation must be selected or switched at runtime.
- Useful in applications where platform independence is desired.
- Applicable when a class needs to be extended in several independent dimensions.

## Considerations

- Complexity: The pattern can add complexity to the code, making it harder to understand and maintain.
- Initial Overhead: The initial setup might be more complicated than necessary when simpler solutions could suffice.
