# Observer Pattern
## Behavioral Design Pattern

The Observer Pattern is a foundational design pattern in software engineering, used to create a one-to-many dependency between objects. It's especially useful in scenarios where a system is made up of multiple components that operate independently but need to remain coordinated or synchronized.

## Key Components

1. **Subject (Observable):**
    - Maintains a list of its observers.
    - Provides an interface for attaching and detaching observer objects.
    - Notifies all attached observers when there's a change in its state.

2. **Observer:**
    - An interface or abstract class defining the `update` method.
    - All observers must implement this method.
    - The method is called when the subject changes its state.

3. **Concrete Subject:**
    - A concrete implementation of the subject interface.
    - Keeps the system's state.
    - Notifies observers on state changes.

4. **Concrete Observer:**
    - A concrete implementation of the observer interface.
    - Contains logic to be updated in response to subject's state change.

5. **Notification Mechanism:**
    - The subject calls the `update` method on each observer when there's a state change.
    - Observers react to these changes as required.

## Advantages

- **Loose Coupling:** The pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers. Observers can dynamically subscribe to or unsubscribe from the subject, allowing for flexibility and ease of maintenance.

## Use Cases

- Commonly used in user interface toolkits where changes in UI elements need to be reflected across various components.
- Useful in distributed systems where events in one part of the system need to be communicated to other parts.

## Considerations

- Proper management of the relationships between subjects and observers is crucial to avoid issues like memory leaks or performance bottlenecks.
