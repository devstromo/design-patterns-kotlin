# Template Method Pattern

## Behavioral Design Pattern

The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in a
method, called the template method, which defers some steps to subclasses. This pattern allows subclasses to redefine
certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. It is particularly useful for minimizing code
duplication, as the common behavior is implemented once in the abstract class's template method, while the varying
behavior is implemented in subclasses.

## Key Components

1. **Abstract Class:**
    - Defines abstract primitive operations that concrete subclasses should implement.
    - Implements a template method defining the structure of an algorithm. The template method calls primitive
      operations as well as operations defined in AbstractClass or those of other objects.

2. **Concrete Class:**
    - Implements the primitive operations to carry out subclass-specific steps of the algorithm.

## Advantages

- **Code Reusability:** Allows the reuse of code in the abstract class, reducing duplication across subclasses.
- **Standardization:** Ensures that the algorithm's structure remains unchanged, while the details can be defined by
  subclasses, thus standardizing the overall process.
- **Control at One Point:** Centralizes the control logic in one location, making it easier to maintain and modify.

## Use Cases

- Ideal when there is a fixed part of the algorithm that should not be changed and a variable part that is subject to
  extension by subclasses.
- Useful in frameworks where a general process should be defined in an abstract class, allowing specific steps to be
  implemented differently by subclasses.
- Common in data processing applications where the structure of the process is constant but the details depend on the
  data.

## Considerations

- The abstract class can become too bulky if too many steps are left unimplemented, making it difficult to understand or
  modify.
- Subclasses must conform to the interface defined by the template method, which can limit flexibility if the steps
  defined in the template method are too restrictive.
