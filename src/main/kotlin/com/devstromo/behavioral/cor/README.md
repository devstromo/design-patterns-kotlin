# Chain of Responsibility Pattern
## Behavioral Design Pattern

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows passing the request along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern allows an object to send a command without knowing which object will handle the command.

## Key Components

1. **Handler:**
   - An interface that defines how requests should be handled or passed along the chain.
   - May implement the successor link (the next handler to which the request should be passed).

2. **Concrete Handler:**
   - Implements the Handler interface.
   - Handles the request it is responsible for, or passes it to the next handler in the chain.
   - Each handler has the logic to decide whether to process the request or pass it along.

3. **Client:**
   - Initiates the request to a chain of handler objects.
   - May or may not know about the chain’s structure and composition.

## Advantages

- **Decoupling of Request Sender and Receivers:** The pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.
- **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** Handlers can be added or changed dynamically without affecting existing code.
- **Promotes Single Responsibility Principle:** Encourages splitting the handling of different requests into separate classes.

## Use Cases

- Useful when there are multiple ways to handle a request, and the handler is not known a priori but should be determined automatically.
- Ideal for implementing filters or interceptors in which a request passes through a series of handlers that may or may not process it.

## Considerations

- The request can end up unhandled if the chain doesn’t include a handler that can deal with it.
- Care should be taken to avoid creating very long chains, which can affect performance and debugging difficulty.
