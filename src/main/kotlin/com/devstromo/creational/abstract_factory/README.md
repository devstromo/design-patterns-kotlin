# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Creational Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related
or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is especially useful for systems that need
to be independent of how their products are created, composed, and represented. It involves a series of factory methods,
one for each type of object to be created.

## Key Components

1. **Abstract Factory:**
    - An interface that declares a set of methods for creating one or more types of related products.
    - These methods return products of a specific family but are implemented by factory objects that return products of
      a single family.

2. **Concrete Factory:**
    - Implements the abstract factory interface to create concrete products.
    - Each factory corresponds to a specific product family.

3. **Abstract Product:**
    - Declares an interface for a type of product object.
    - Defines the role and characteristics of a specific product class implemented by concrete product subclasses.

4. **Concrete Product:**
    - Implements the abstract product interface to define products to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.
    - Products of a factory are all related or dependent but are used independently by client code.

5. **Client:**
    - Uses interfaces declared by the Abstract Factory and Abstract Product classes.
    - Accesses only the interfaces exposed by the factories and products, working with products through these
      interfaces.

## Advantages

- **Isolation of Concrete Classes:** Clients interact with instances through their abstract interfaces. This isolates
  the client code from the implementation details of the classes derived from these interfaces.
- **Exchange of Product Families:** Supports easy interchange of product families as it allows the instantiation of a
  group of products from a specific family all at once.
- **Consistency Among Products:** Guarantees that the products you obtain from a factory are compatible with each other.

## Use Cases

- Ideal when there is a need to create families of related products designed to be used together.
- Useful when a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- Applicable in cross-platform software development, allowing for the creation of platform-specific components that all
  adhere to the same interface.

## Considerations

- The pattern can become complicated if a large number of new product types is introduced, necessitating changes to the
  Abstract Factory interface.
- It may require introducing a lot of new classes, as each new type of product requires extending both the factory and
  the product structure.
