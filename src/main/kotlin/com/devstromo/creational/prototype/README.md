# Prototype Pattern

## Creational Design Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that involves creating objects by cloning a prototype instead of
through instantiation. This pattern is particularly useful when the creation of an object is complex or costly, and a
similar object already exists. The prototype object itself serves as the basis for creating new objects, with the
capability to clone itself to spawn new objects.

## Key Components

1. **Prototype:**
    - An interface that defines the methods for cloning itself.
    - Typically declares a method for cloning the prototype.

2. **Concrete Prototype:**
    - Implements the prototype interface by cloning itself.
    - When it clones itself, it provides the same state as the original object, or might include modifications.

3. **Client:**
    - Creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself.
    - The client can modify the new object after receiving the cloned version, if necessary.

## Advantages

- **Performance Enhancement:** Avoids costly creation processes by cloning objects.
- **Flexibility:** Clients can get new objects without knowing the details of their creation.
- **Reduced Subclassing:** Prototyping avoids the need for subclassing by cloning pre-configured objects.

## Use Cases

- Ideal for situations where application needs to create objects dynamically.
- Useful in scenarios where the system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- Applicable when classes to be instantiated are specified at runtime.

## Considerations

- Implementing the cloning operation can be tricky, especially if the objects have complex references to other objects.
- Care must be taken to properly clone objects when they have circular references or complex recursive compositions.
