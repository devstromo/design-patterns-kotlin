# Builder Pattern

## Creational Design Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the construction of complex objects step by step. It
separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create
different representations. This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with many optional
components or configurations.

## Key Components

1. **Builder:**
    - An interface that defines all the steps needed to build a product.
    - Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.

2. **Concrete Builder:**
    - Implements the Builder interface.
    - Provides the implementation for those steps.
    - Keeps track of the construction process and offers methods to retrieve the finished object.

3. **Director:**
    - Constructs an object using the Builder interface.
    - Responsible for managing the correct sequence of object creation.
    - Accepts a Builder as a parameter and executes the necessary operations on it.

4. **Product:**
    - The final object that is produced from the Builder pattern.
    - Represents the complex object under construction. Concrete Builder builds the product's internal representation
      and defines the process by which it's assembled.

## Advantages

- **Separation of Construction and Representation:** Allows for the construction process to create different
  representations.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulates the way a complex object is constructed.
- **Flexibility:** Provides more control over the construction process compared to other creational patterns.

## Use Cases

- Ideal for creating complex objects with numerous initialization parameters, especially if many of them are optional or
  the object's configuration can vary widely.
- Useful in scenarios where product variations need to be created but the complexity should be hidden from the client.

## Considerations

- May result in a complex design with many additional classes if each step of the construction process is very detailed
  or requires a separate builder method.
- The pattern can overcomplicate the code for simple implementations or when only a few configurations of an object are
  needed.
